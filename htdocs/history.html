				Vaccine hesitancy has been around for a long time in the 
				Philippines but the event that made it turn into what it 
				is today can be accounted to the Dengvaxia vaccine during 
				2016. The controversy surrounding this vaccine started one 
				year after the anti-dengue immunization program was initiated 
				in 2016 by former President Benigno Aquino III. The company that 
				created Dengvaxia found out that it increased the chances of getting 
				dengue for seronegative patients. This finding connected the Dengvaxia 
				several deaths in the Philippines. This made people wary of the government 
				due to some thinking it was a ploy to weaponize Dengvaxia. This lowered the 
				faith of the Filipino citizens in vaccinations and in the government. It also 
				showed that back in 2015 93% of Filipinos had faith in the vaccine, unfortunately 
				this stooped down to a mere 32% in 2018. Pre-covid the Filipino citizens were already 
				ary of vaccines. This was the main event that led to the vaccine hesitancy that is happening 
				in the present.
